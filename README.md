# Roast-Scraper
A project to scrape the roasts displayed on safeway's public website to track prices as i am a roast fanatic.

Inspiration came from my love of pot roast & safeways friendly website & [realpython.com's "A Practical Introduction to Web Scraping in Python"](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/)


### Objectives
- learn github better & get a handle on basic development flow  
- create a project demonstrating my skills/comphrension of python w/ a simple & somewhat novel & orignal idea
- demonstrate my comprehension in HTML & python//urllib

### Future improvements / goals
[ ] Create concept script
[ ] Make it automatically run on my RPI 4B at home & email me a report daily & track how that goes here in a writeup
[ ] Create GUI??
